# Portfolio-Optimization---Mutual-Funds-Final.xlsx
This project applies Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) to construct an optimized mutual fund portfolio that maximizes returns while minimizing risk. Using historical NAV data and Excel Solver, the project demonstrates how to allocate assets efficiently under real-world investment constraints.

**Key Objectives**
Analyze historical performance of selected mutual funds
Calculate expected returns, standard deviation, and covariance
Apply Mean-Variance Optimization to build an efficient portfolio
Use Excel Solver to find the optimal weights
Evaluate results using the Sharpe Ratio and efficient frontier concepts
